                <h3>Bitcoin’s Value Over Time</h3>
                <p>The value of Bitcoin has been incredibly volatile since its inception. Here's an overview of the major price movements over the years:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>2010:</strong> Bitcoin was worth pennies, as very few people knew about it or its potential value.</li>
                    <li><strong>2011:</strong> The value rose to $1 per BTC, marking the first major milestone in its journey.</li>
                    <li><strong>2013:</strong> After a series of price surges and corrections, Bitcoin briefly reached $1,000 per BTC.</li>
                    <li><strong>2017:</strong> Bitcoin skyrocketed to nearly $20,000 in December, fueled by speculation and widespread media coverage.</li>
                    <li><strong>2018:</strong> Bitcoin faced a dramatic price crash, dropping to below $4,000 by the end of the year.</li>
                    <li><strong>2020-2021:</strong> Bitcoin surged again, reaching all-time highs of over $60,000, driven by institutional investors and corporate interest (Tesla, MicroStrategy).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Despite its volatility, many investors see Bitcoin as a store of value similar to gold, especially in the face of inflationary pressures on traditional fiat currencies.</p>

                <h3>Factors Influencing Bitcoin's Price</h3>
                <p>Several factors contribute to the price of Bitcoin, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Supply and demand:</strong> Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million, creating scarcity. When demand rises, the price increases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Media coverage:</strong> Positive or negative media attention often impacts investor sentiment, driving price fluctuations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Market sentiment:</strong> Fear and greed play significant roles in Bitcoin's price movements. Major events like regulatory announcements or macroeconomic changes can lead to large price swings.</li>

                <h3>How to Get Started with Bitcoin Investing</h3>
                <p>If you're interested in investing in Bitcoin, here are the steps to get started:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose a secure cryptocurrency exchange or brokerage to buy Bitcoin. Popular options include Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Set up a Bitcoin wallet to store your BTC. There are different types of wallets, including hardware, software, and mobile wallets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Decide how much you want to invest. Bitcoin is highly volatile, so it's essential to only invest money that you can afford to lose.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Purchase Bitcoin and track your investment. Many investors choose to "HODL" (Hold On for Dear Life) during market dips.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Stay informed about market trends and news. Bitcoin’s price can be influenced by various factors, so keeping up with the latest information is critical.</li>

                    <li><strong>Market manipulation:</strong> Bitcoin’s relatively small market size makes it susceptible to manipulation by large players.</li>
                </ul>
